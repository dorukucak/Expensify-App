# Expensify-App

An app that tracks and lists expenses.

## How to run

Dependencies of the project is relatively old. It is recommended to install node-sass by ```yarn add node-sass``` or ```npm i node-sass``` before installing dependencies.

Currently the project runs best on the **development server** which is or ```yarn dev-server``` ```npm run dev-server```. Dev-server runs at http://localhost:8080

Data is stored in a Firebase real-time database. Initially the app will fetch data and show a loading screen while the user waits. 

TODOs:
* Login
* DB improvement
* Prepare to run on production server
